Saumya kanchan,"Good morning to our Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister,

I am a student of Class 10th and I would like to request you to talk about the topic of how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is impacting jobs of multiple people. Even though AI is more of a boon than a curse, as it helps in deep research, studies, healthcare and many other fields, it is also true that AI is taking away people‚Äôs jobs. For example, in many companies, AI tools are now being used to write reports and create designs, which earlier required human employees, thus reducing job opportunities.

AI has two sides ‚Äî it makes work easier and creative, but also replaces some jobs, creating fear of unemployment. Data shows that while many workers enjoy AI, a large number also worry about losing their jobs. If our Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister could share his thoughts and solutions, it would truly guide students like me.

Akshit Bhardwaj,"Respected Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji,

Namaste.

I am a passionate student aspiring to become an IAS officer one day and serve our great nation. I was truly inspired by your recent initiative that allows students to experience One Day as a Scientist. It‚Äôs a brilliant way to ignite young minds and fuel their curiosity.

In a similar spirit, I humbly request you to consider starting a program called ""One Day as an IAS Officer"", where students get the opportunity to shadow an IAS officer for a day. This would give us invaluable exposure to the responsibilities and challenges of civil service, and further strengthen our commitment to public service.

I believe this initiative will inspire many young Indians to dream big and work hard to contribute to the nation‚Äôs progress.

Thank you for always motivating the youth.

With deep respect,
Yours truly

AkashSahoo,"Respected Prime Minister,

I propose creating a dedicated Judicial Security & Enforcement Wing within the CISF. This unit can safeguard judges and courts, protect witnesses under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018 (approved by the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court on 5 December 2018), and manage prisoner escort and the tracking of fugitives.

Importantly, this new wing could also provide a natural reemployment pathway for Agniveers, who already have the discipline and training required. By giving them this role, we strengthen our judiciary while also honouring our commitment to India‚Äôs young soldiers.

Entrusting these duties to a neutral central force would shield justice from local political or mafia influence and free up the CBI and state police to focus on complex investigations. This reform would ensure justice is secure, fearless, and timely across India.","Inviting Ideas for Mann Ki Baat by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 28th September 2025

SANDIP PATIL,"Respected Sir,I would like to draw your kind attention to the urgent need for establishing an InformationTechnology (IT) Park in Nashik, Maharashtra.The Nashik Municipal Corporation has already reserved approximately 350 acres of land inthe Adgaon-Mhasrul area, strategically located near the Mumbai‚ÄìAgra National Highway(NH-3). Notably, an IT park in Nashik was first proposed in 2003 and was inaugurated by thethen Hon‚Äôble Union Minister, Late Shri Pramod Mahajan. However, the project wasunfortunately shelved thereafter, and no significant progress has been made since.Given Nashik‚Äôs growing population, its educated youth, and its potential as a regional growthhub in North Maharashtra, the development of a modern IT park is both timely and essential.This initiative would not only boost the local economy but also generate significantemployment opportunities for thousands of skilled individuals in the region.I humbly request you to kindly take up this matter at the Ministry level by convening a reviewmeeting with the concerned departments. Your support in approving and facilitating theestablishment of an IT park at the designated site in Adgaon-Mhasrul would be a monumentalstep toward transforming Nashik into a prominent IT destination.Thank you for your time and consideration.",Inviting Ideas for Mann Ki Baat by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 28th September 2025
sandip patil,"Respected Hon‚Äôble Prime Minister,
I am writing to you as a concerned citizen regarding the current state of the Central
Information Commission (CIC), which is functioning with only three Information
Commissioners, including the Chief Information Commissioner, whereas the Right to
Information Act, 2005 provides for up to eleven Commissioners in total.
The CIC plays a pivotal role in upholding the values of transparency, accountability, and
good governance by ensuring timely access to information under the RTI Act. However, the
acute shortage of Commissioners has severely impacted the Commission‚Äôs functioning,
leading to increasing backlogs and prolonged delays in hearing and disposing of appeals and
complaints.
The RTI Act empowers the Central Government to appoint the Chief Information
Commissioner and up to ten Information Commissioners. The present situation, where eight
posts remain vacant, is hindering the very purpose of the Act and affecting citizens'
fundamental right to information.
In the spirit of ""Minimum Government, Maximum Governance"", it is essential that the
Commission is adequately staffed to serve its mandate effectively and promptly.
I humbly urge your esteemed office to kindly:
1. Take immediate steps to appoint the remaining Central Information Commissioners
to ensure the Commission functions at its full strength.
2. Ensure that the process of appointments is transparent and based on merit, in
keeping with the democratic spirit of the RTI Act.
3. Consider further strengthening the CIC with necessary administrative support to
improve efficiency and reduce pendency.
Your timely intervention will not only restore the effectiveness of the CIC but will also
reaffirm the government‚Äôs commitment to transparency and participatory governance.Thank you for your attention and anticipated action on this important matter.","Inviting Ideas for Mann Ki Baat by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 28th September 2025

Sandip Patil,"Note for Committee on Ethanol-Petrol Blending Effectiveness
The practice of blending ethanol with petrol (E10, E20) is intended to reduce fossil fuel
dependency, support cleaner energy, and promote rural/agricultural growth. However,
several concerns warrant a detailed review:
1. Fuel Efficiency Impact: Ethanol has lower energy content than petrol, leading to reduced
mileage (up to 8‚Äì10% in E20 blends), directly affecting consumer fuel economy.
2. Vehicle Compatibility & Maintenance: Ethanol‚Äôs corrosive nature and moisture absorption
properties may damage components in older or non-compatible engines, increasing
maintenance costs.
3. Cost to Consumers: The combination of reduced mileage and potential maintenance
requirements may offset the intended economic benefits of ethanol blending for end users.
4. Environmental Considerations: While ethanol reduces carbon monoxide and particulate
emissions, concerns exist regarding the environmental impact of large-scale ethanol
production‚Äîsuch as water use, land diversion from food crops, and carbon intensity of
processing.
5. Conflict of Interest & Profit Transparency: It has been reported that a company owned by
the Union Minister‚Äôs son has recorded a 115% profit increase in the ethanol sector. This
raises potential conflict of interest concerns and underscores the need for greater
transparency and unbiased evaluation of the blending policy.
Recommendation:
A neutral, multidisciplinary committee should be constituted to assess the overall
effectiveness, economic implications, and governance transparency of ethanol blending. The
goal should be to determine whether continuing, modifying, or phasing out ethanol
blending aligns with the broader national interest‚Äîbalancing environmental, economic, and
ethical considerations","Inviting Ideas for Mann Ki Baat by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 28th September 2025

Product packaging and instructions should be available in multiple accessible formats, such as braille, large print, and digital screen-reader-friendly versions.
Suggestions include easy-to-open packaging, large and easily accessible buttons or touch controls, lightweight materials, and designs that allow for one-handed operation.

Suggestions include mandating compliance for all government, public sector, and private organizations that provide public services.

Accessibility features should not significantly increase product costs, and the government should consider providing subsidies and incentives to manufacturers.

Key requirements include physical accessibility through easy-to-reach and operable controls, visual accessibility via high-contrast displays and clear labeling, auditory accessibility with visual or tactile alternatives to sound, and digital accessibility by complying with WCAG guidelines. Products should also support cognitive accessibility through simple language, clear instructions, and consistent design, while packaging and documentation must include large print, Braille, and accessible digital formats.

Hanumathuabhishek,"Road safety is one of the most important concerns in India. While large metropolitan cities are becoming more disciplined in following traffic rules due to strict monitoring and enforcement, the situation in small towns and semi-urban areas is very different. In these places, traffic rules are often neglected, and awareness levels are much lower. People frequently drive without helmets, seatbelts, or proper documents, which leads to a high number of accidents. Overspeeding, drunk driving, and careless driving are also common issues.

Every year, thousands of people lose their lives in road accidents, and many more suffer permanent injuries. The majority of these accidents occur in smaller cities and towns where traffic rules are either not followed or not strictly enforced. Therefore, the government should implement stronger measures to ensure that road safety becomes a priority everywhere, not only in metro",Inviting comments and suggestions on the Draft Accessibility Standards for the Products Sector

Srivenkata Ramakrishna Namburi,"Dear Sir,
Living in India as physically disabled is HELL. I am sorry to put this across. Before we even discuss about ACCESSIBILITY Products, following has to be put in place:
1. ROADs in colonies and Major thoroughfare are not suitable for physically disabled across INDIA. Show me a distance of 1 Kilometer where a disabled person can move on wheelchair comfortably. If we as Government cannot provide a ROAD for easy accessibility, we need to design a standard such that WHEELCHAIRS can navigate on INDIAN Roads
2. RAILWAYS - No platform in INDIA Railway station or STAIRCASE to train coaches is disabled friendly, if we cannot change the platforms, DESIGN a product such that disabled person can easily climb on to the train.
3. Forget about disabled person, able senior citizens & children cannot use ROADS safely.

When we talk about products, we mostly think about something tangible. Now, the need of an hour is looking at Software Products, Maybe it is an operating system or mailbox or social media platform. Consider a hypothetical situation. The major player on this sector if takes out their service and how it will be ? So, it is time to work with major tech companies to make this indigenous.
Yes, for initial days, this will be challenging for revenue, but having a govt approved social media platform can help to get revenue from add, which further can be utilized on free services like mail.

My research of Goods value , manpower value , and brand value lives with the customer the buyer . we the buyer are loosing this is research point.

1. why to value Indian customer buy power with forign currency this is a big mistake of past .
2. if Indian currency value grows yeae on year people across world will buy .
3. release a international currency without fear now is the time and global people can buy it . actually it is a no game so no need to actually print.
4. Global currency for every countries use and managed by every countey call it Global money and symnol is GM.

No exchange price for that currency and to buy global currency need to give any goods of global standard price . like Gold ,silver, urenium, may be pharma , or food grain to global mandi. and take international currency. some country may have only leather to sell then sell and take global currency of the leather value . ang buy internationally any thing.

Devvrath Jain,"Why Product Standards Matter

In a world saturated with choices, from the smartphone in your hand to the food on your shelf, how can consumers be confident in the safety, quality, and compatibility of what they buy? The answer often lies in a silent, unseen force: industry standards.

A product standard is essentially a agreed-upon recipe for success. It is a set of detailed guidelines, specifications, and procedures that manufacturers follow to ensure their products are reliable, safe, and consistent. These standards can cover everything from the dimensions of a screw thread and the safety of electrical components to the ethical sourcing of materials.

The benefits of standardization are profound:
Safety and Reliability: First and foremost, standards protect consumers. They ensure that electrical appliances won't electrocute users, that toys are free from",Inviting comments and suggestions on the Draft Accessibility Standards for the Products Sector

Manufacturing Audits to Prevent Oversight Lapses: Implement unannounced inspections by third-party agencies, with blockchain-logged reports. Suggestion: Penalize delays or falsifications harshly, ensuring no irresponsible evasion of standards.
Certification Integrity Measures: Use multi-agency cross-verification (e.g., BIS and environmental bodies) for approvals, with public dashboards tracking timelines to expose delays indicative of corruption.
Distribution Network Scrutiny: Require wholesalers to log compliance via audited apps, flagging anomalies for investigation.

Human beings can neither create nor destroy energy . They can only transform one kind of energy into another form like heat energy to electrical Energy. Energy has quality like electric energy is highest quality energy. We should never use electrical energy for heating purposes. By doing so we are degrading high quality energy to a poor quality heat energy. This is a highly irreversible process which results in increase in Entropy of the Universe which leads to a decrease in the availability of Energy on earth.
